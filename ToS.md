Effective Date: September 18, 2025
Last Updated: September 18, 2025  

Welcome to LoopLend (‚ÄúLoopLend,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù), a community-driven platform for lending and borrowing physical items (e.g., tools, gear, gadgets) within a local radius using a token-based system. These Terms of Service (‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) govern your use of the LoopLend mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù). By downloading, installing, creating an account, or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.
These Terms are publicly available on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/LoopLend-legal-policies. This version and the in-app version are authoritative. Historical versions are available on GitHub for transparency.


1. Purpose of LoopLend
LoopLend enables users to lend and borrow physical items within a hyper-local 5-mile radius (or 10-mile for premium users), fostering sustainability, reducing waste, and building trust through a gamified token system (no cash for core trades). Our mission is to create strong community loops where users share responsibly and safely. üîÑ


2. Eligibility
To use LoopLend, you must:

Be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction).
Be legally capable of entering into a binding contract.
Reside in a country where LoopLend operates (currently available nationwide in the United States, with potential expansion to other regions).
Not be a person barred from using the Services under applicable laws.

Children‚Äôs Restrictions: LoopLend is not intended for users under 13 (or 16 in the European Economic Area under GDPR). We rely on users to self-report their age and do not knowingly allow use by children below these ages.
By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.


3. Account Registration

Registration: You must create an account using a valid email address or anonymous one-time password (OTP) login via Firebase Authentication.
Account Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities under your account.
Accurate Information: You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to update it as needed.
Account Responsibility: You are liable for any misuse of your account, including unauthorized access due to failure to secure your credentials.


4. Tokens, Deposits, and Payments
a. Token System
LoopLend uses in-app tokens for lending and borrowing transactions. Tokens:

Are earned by lending items or completing successful loops.
Can be purchased via Google Play Billing or Apple In-App Purchases ($0.99 for 5 tokens to $4.99 for 50 tokens).
Are subject to a 20% cap on purchased tokens to ensure fairness in the community.
Have no cash value, are non-transferable, and cannot be redeemed for money or other currencies.

b. Deposits

A double-token deposit is required for each loan to ensure trust and accountability.
Deposits are held in escrow via Firebase Cloud Functions until the item is returned, as verified by photo proof (pickup/return, hash difference >20%).
If an item is not returned within the agreed loan duration plus a 24-hour grace period, LoopLend may initiate mediation. Deposits may be forfeited to the lender or refunded based on mediation outcomes.

c. Fees

LoopLend charges a 5% service fee on token deposits to support platform operations.
A premium subscription ($2.99/month via Google Play Billing or Apple In-App Purchases) provides priority listings, a 10-mile radius, an ad-free experience, and a 50% token bonus on purchases.

d. Refunds

Token purchases and subscriptions are subject to the refund policies of Google Play or Apple App Store.
Deposits are refunded to the borrower upon verified item return. Non-return disputes are resolved via mediation (see Section 9).
LoopLend does not offer cash refunds for tokens or subscriptions, as tokens have no monetary value.

e. No Cash Transactions
LoopLend is not a marketplace for direct sales or cash-based rentals. All transactions must use the in-app token system.


5. User Responsibilities
As a LoopLend user, you agree to:

Accurately describe items you list (e.g., condition, functionality, loan duration, token cost).
Return borrowed items on time and in the condition received, accounting for normal wear and tear.
Meet in safe, public locations (e.g., parks, cafes suggested as ‚ÄúSafe Spots‚Äù by LoopLend).
Upload truthful photo proof of item handoff and return, as required by the platform.
Communicate respectfully and professionally with other users via in-app chat.
Comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws during transactions.

You agree not to:

Post or exchange illegal, stolen, hazardous, or prohibited items (e.g., weapons, drugs).
Engage in fraudulent, deceptive, or scamming behavior (e.g., misrepresenting items, falsifying photo proof).
Use LoopLend for commercial rental businesses or sales without express written permission from LoopLend.
Circumvent security measures, manipulate ratings/tokens, or use automated scripts/bots to interact with the Services.
Harass, threaten, or defame other users or post inappropriate content.


6. Trust, Ratings, and Enforcement

Trust Badges: Earn a ‚ÄúGold Looper‚Äù badge by completing 5 successful trades and verifying your identity with a blurred government-issued ID.

To ensure a safe and trusted community, LoopLend implements:

ID Verification: Optional blurred government-issued ID for trust badges, stored securely in Firebase Storage.

Photo Verification: Requires photo proof for item handoff/return, with Cloud Functions checking for >20% hash difference to confirm authenticity.
Double-Token Deposits: Ensures accountability for loans, with a 24-hour grace period.
One-Tap Reporting: Allows users to report fraud/theft via a lime green ‚ÄúReport Scam/Theft‚Äù button, logged to Firestore for investigation.

Accounts engaging in fraudulent, abusive, or illegal behavior may be suspended or banned, with no refund of tokens or subscriptions.


9. Dispute Resolution
LoopLend provides an in-app mediation process for disputes, including non-returned items or disagreements:

Both parties may upload photo proof to support their claims.
LoopLend reviews evidence (e.g., photos, chat logs, ratings) within 24 hours.
Outcomes may include releasing deposits to the lender, refunding the borrower, or escalating to further mediation.
